messagebird
===========

Unofficial node.js module for the MessageBird API.

* [MessageBird](https://www.messagebird.com/)
* [API documentation](https://www.messagebird.com/download/technical_documentation_nl.pdf)



Installation
------------

The best way is to install the [npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/messagebird).

```bash
npm install messagebird
```

Alternatively you can install directly from the source code on Github, but this can be unstable!

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-messagebird
```


Configuration
-------------

```
username   required   Your API username.
password   required   Your API password.
timeout    option     Abort request after this amount of milliseconds.
                      (default 5000)
```


Usage
-----

```js
var messagebird = require('messagebird')

messagebird.username = 'myname'
messagebird.password = 'mysecret'

messagebird.credits( function( err, data ) {
	if( ! err ) {
		console.log( 'â‚¬ '+ data.euro +' and '+ data.credits +' credits left' )
	} else {
		console.log( 'An error occured:' )
		console.log( err )
	}
})
```


Dependencies
------------

npm should fix the dependencies for you.

* [node-xml2json](https://npmjs.org/package/node-xml2json) v1.0 - This is a small and fast library for XML to JSON translation.


Callback & error handling
-------------------------

Each method below takes a callback _function_ as last parameter to receive the result status and data. This function receives two parameters: `err` and `data`. When an error occurs `err` will be an instance of `Error` with stack trace and possibly additional properties, `data` won't be set. When everything is good `err` is _null_ and `data` is the result.

```js
function myCallback( err, data ) {
	if( err ) {
		console.log( err )
		console.log( err.stack )
	} else {
		console.log( data )
	}
}

messagebird.credits( myCallback )
```
